                            Degrees in the United Kingdom take three or four years to complete, depending on where you study. 
                            Degrees in England/Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland typically take three years. A postgraduate 
                            degree is completed in one year. This implies you will pay less money on tuition. Furthermore, 
                            there are several scholarships, grants, and bursaries available from institutions and universities.

                            In the UK, International students are normally permitted to work up to 20 hours per week during term 
                            time and full-time outside of term time. This will enable you to obtain useful job experience, 
                            meet new people, and earn money while continuing your education.
                            From the summer of 2021, anyone who has completed a UK degree will be eligible for the Graduate Route initiative. 
                            This allows you to stay and work in the United Kingdom for up to two years after graduating.
                            Most university courses enable and encourage students to do an internship as part of their studies; 
                            in fact, some schools may even offer this as a module. 
                            This means you may gain experience and boost your CV before even graduating!
